/* Challenge 02 

Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and 
improve it.
Your tasks:

1.  Print a nice output to the console, saying who has the higher BMI. The message 
is either "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!"

2.  Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the outputs. Example: "Mark's 
BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!"

Hint: Use an if/else statement ðŸ˜‰

const markMass = 95,
      markHeight = 1.88,
      johnMass = 85,
      johnHeight = 1.76;


let markBMI = markMass / markHeight ** 2;

let johnBMI = johnMass / (johnHeight * johnHeight);

if(markBMI > johnBMI){
  console.log(`Mark's BMI (${markBMI.toFixed(2)}) is higher than John's (${johnBMI.toFixed(2)})!`);
}
else{
  console.log(`John's BMI (${johnBMI.toFixed(2)}) is higher than Mark's (${markBMI.toFixed(2)})!`);
}
